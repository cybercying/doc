# The Architect of Struggle Part 2: Delving Into the Journey of Awakening

## Disclaimer for Reading This Material

The following content details my personal experience with detoxification and awakening, as part of my journey to resist the influence of the malevolent entity described in this work. It is critical to understand the following:

1. **Personal Experience Only**: The guidance provided is specific to my own body and circumstances, derived from my unique epiphany. It is not intended or suitable for others, as individual responses to such practices vary widely and may pose risks if applied without personalization.

2. **Use of Code Names**: To avoid misinterpretation, I use metaphorical code names instead of actual substances or methods. I will not provide direct instructions or identify specific substances, as this could be misconstrued as medical guidance, which I am not qualified to offer.

3. **Not Medical Advice**: Nothing in this chapter should be construed as medical, health, or therapeutic advice. For any health-related concerns or decisions, including detoxification or dietary changes, consult a licensed medical professional. Always prioritize professional medical guidance over the speculative content presented here.

4. **Treat as Fiction if Unclear**: If the metaphors, code names, or guidance are confusing or unclear, treat this chapter as a fictional narrative. It is not intended to be a practical guide for others. My sole aim is to share my personal story within the context of this philosophical work, not to prescribe actions for readers.

## How can one remove the implants and acheive awakening?

After reading the first part of "The Architect of Struggle" series, a logical question to ask is, **"How can one identify and remove the implants to achieve clearer thinking (awakening) and resist the entity's control?"** Here, I will address this question directly.

It's important to understand that removing implants to achieve clearer thinking isn't necessarily for everyone. It's an extremely personal choice. Let's break it down:

1. **Challenges:** Though removing implants could bring you clearer thinking, it could also introduce another layer of struggle. The detox procedure can be potentially painful, time-consuming, and complicated. Additionally, I should note that I don't think the complete removal of implants is possible merely with personal efforts. The reason for that is that 1. implants are too pervasive; they are virtually in every corner of your body. 2. when you remove some implants, new implants are still being ingested into your system. (The only way one can remove all implants is we destroy the underlying mind control infrastructure, which I don't know a way to do that without unifying everyone's effort in the first place.)
2. **First step:** The first step to removing an implant is to allow your nervous system to sense its existence. It's necessary to understand our body comes with a natural detox function and is designed to heal itself, but first, it must know there is a problem that needs fixing. Thus, the first layer of the implant's defense mechanism is to prevent your nervous system from detecting its presence, thereby escaping the body's natural detox mechanism. The way to address this is to stop consuming any drugs and reduce the intake of processed foods. The entity disperses some kind of lightweight narcotics into air, food, water, and drugs, just as it distributes the implants. It's my understanding that drugs and processed food contain the highest concentration of such lightweight narcotics. If you consume drugs regularly, it is highly unlikely that you will ever feel the implant. However, if your immediate well-being depends on some drugs, I wouldn't recommend stopping them, as this means you are too dependent on the implants and removing them could be harmful to you.
3. **Finding your own detox procedure:** After at least some alleviation of the involuntary intake of lightweight narcotics, combined with a certain degree of meditation, you should be able to start finding a detox procedure that is suitable for you. Although I have found my detox procedure, it’s important to understand that this information is not to be circulated for several reasons. Firstly, my method is only suitable for my body because it came from my epiphany; it’s not necessarily suitable for you. Secondly, circulating this kind of information is risky. Often, it will be framed as medical misinformation and attract unwanted attention, and in some extreme cases, it may even be illegal. I'm not going to lie; obtaining information about a suitable detox procedure for you in this control grid is quite challenging. You need to see through the illusion of the modern medical system to some degree, at least. After the pandemic, perhaps it's not that hard as before. Just research some of the following topics, and you just might be able to see through the illusion: 1. How Big Pharma hijacked the medical institutes systematically from the 1950s. 2. How cancer could be a fake disease. 3. How allopathic medicine systematically rose and how other kinds of medicine, such as homeopathic or holistic medicine, have been systematically suppressed throughout history. Here, we can see that implant removal and awakening (clearer thinking) do not occur as a sequence of steps; rather, they must work in an interlocked manner to achieve true awakening.
4. **Continuous refinement:** After removing a significant portion of the implants, you should be able to think more clearly. This also means you have found a detox method to consistently decrease the amount of implants, and this detox must be continuously applied; otherwise, the ingested implants could accumulate again. This does not mean you should keep doing the same detox procedure; rather, you need to update the procedure according to your body's reactions. After the lightweight narcotics wear off, you receive all kinds of signals transmitted from your body, some of which may even be new to you. You must learn to interpret these signals and update the detox procedure in conjunction with the insights gained from your gradual awakening.
5. **Risks:** I should note that seeing through all the lies is not necessarily a fortunate thing for everyone. It could cause your trust in every system that supported you as you grew up to collapse completely. It's like what was described in the Matrix movie franchise, which explains why they often don't free the minds of adults.
