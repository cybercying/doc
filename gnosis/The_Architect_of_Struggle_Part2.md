## Chapter 1: Implant Removal

After reading the first part of "The Architect of Struggle" series, a logical question to ask is, 
> **How can one identify and remove the implants to achieve clearer thinking (awakening) and resist the entity's control?** 

In this chapter, I will address this question directly.

It's important to understand that removing implants to achieve clearer thinking isn't necessarily for everyone. It's an extremely personal choice. Let's break it down:

### Challenges

Though removing implants could bring you clearer thinking, it could also introduce another layer of struggle. The detox procedure can be potentially painful, time-consuming, and complicated. Additionally, I should note that I don't think the complete removal of implants is possible merely with personal efforts. The reasons for that are:

1. Implants are too pervasive; they are virtually in every corner of your body. 
2. When you remove some implants, new implants are still being ingested into your system. 

In fact, the only way one can remove all implants is we destroy the underlying mind control infrastructure, which I don't know a way to do that without unifying everyone's effort in the first place.

### First Step: Wake Up Your Body

The first step to removing an implant is to allow your nervous system to sense its existence. It's necessary to understand our body comes with a natural detox function and is designed to heal itself, but first, it must know there is a problem that needs fixing. Thus, the first layer of the implant's defense mechanism is to prevent your nervous system from detecting its presence, thereby escaping the body's natural detox mechanism. 

The way to address this is to stop consuming any drugs and reduce the intake of processed foods. The entity disperses some kind of lightweight narcotics into air, food, water, and drugs, just as it distributes the implants, to numb your nervous system, making it ignore the implants. It's my understanding that drugs and processed food contain the highest concentration of such lightweight narcotics. 

In fact, I believe the true function of most pharmaceuticals is to numb the nervous system, thereby suppressing the symptoms and discomfort often caused by the body's self-healing mechanism, which creates the illusion of a cure. However, prolonged suppression of the self-healing mechanism could eventually lead to a catastrophic breakdown of health, and the patient won’t be aware of it until it’s too late.

If you consume drugs regularly, it is highly unlikely that you will ever feel the implants. However, if your immediate well-being depends on some drugs, I wouldn't recommend stopping them, as this means you are too dependent on the implants and removing them could be harmful to you.

### Finding Your Own Detox Procedure

After at least some alleviation of the involuntary intake of lightweight narcotics, combined with a certain degree of meditation, you should be able to start finding a detox procedure that is suitable for you. Although I have found my detox procedure, it’s important to understand that this information is not to be circulated for several reasons. Firstly, my method is only suitable for my body because it came from my epiphany; it’s not necessarily suitable for you. Secondly, circulating this kind of information is risky. Often, it will be framed as medical misinformation and attract unwanted attention, and in some extreme cases, it may even be illegal. 

I'm not going to lie; obtaining information about a suitable detox procedure for you in this control grid is quite challenging. If you are determined to embark on the path of awakening, you need to see through the illusion of the modern medical system to at least some degree. After the pandemic, perhaps it's not that hard as before. Just research some of the following topics, and you just might be able to see through the illusion: 

1. How Big Pharma hijacked the medical institutes systematically from the 1950s.
2. How cancer could be a fake disease.
3. How allopathic medicine systematically rose and how other kinds of medicine, such as homeopathic or holistic medicine, have been systematically suppressed throughout history.
  
Here, we can see that implant removal and awakening (clearer thinking) do not occur as a sequence of steps; rather, they must work in an interlocked and iterative manner to achieve true awakening. You gain a bit of awakening and learn a bit about detox, which in turn allows you to gain more awakening, and so on. That's how it works.

Researching the topics described above could be challenging. For this, I have provided my own experience for reference in the next chapter.

### Continuous Refinement

After removing a significant portion of the implants, you should be able to think more clearly. This also means you have found a detox method to consistently decrease the amount of implants, and this detox must be continuously applied; otherwise, the ingested implants could accumulate again.

This does not mean you should keep doing the same detox procedure. The "detox method" refers to an effective system that you create to gain epiphanies about designing your own treatment, experiment on your body, and then gather feedback to update or create other treatments. It's a dynamically evolving system specifically adapted for you, rather than a single or static procedure. You need use the detox method to continuously refine the procedures according to your body's reactions.

After the lightweight narcotics wear off, you receive all kinds of signals transmitted from your body, some of which may even be new to you. You must learn to interpret these signals and update the detox procedure in conjunction with the insights gained from your gradual awakening.

### Develop Your Own Treatment with Discernment

Discernment during the detox cycle is extremely important. It's my understanding that the implants are present in every part of everyone's body because none of us have done this before, unless we possess the knowledge. The implants have been accumulating since we were born, so it's safe to assume that they are always in a state of overflow. For example, I believe acne, a skin disease common in young people, is actually the body's natural detox reaction to push excessive implants out of the body. Mainstream medicine will, of course, dismiss this interpretation outright, but that's expected, as this will continue to happen if you decide to embark on the journey.

#### Signals from the Hidden Protector

When the detox starts, the body automatically selects a part of body to begin detoxing according to its own priority. The actual detox process is very intricate, and only a part of your subconscious understands how it really works. Here, I'm referring to the aspect of the subconscious that protects the body, which I term your "hidden protector." The hidden protector will automatically create a plan to detox based on the treatments available to you. It will then tell you how to help it treat the body by transmitting signals to you. These signals could manifest in several ways: 

1. **Symptoms in certain body parts:** This means maybe that body part needs some kind of treatment.
2. **Sudden urges or desires to do something:** This means maybe the body need some kind of ingredient that it lacks in order to do its job, or that it desire some kind of spiritual connection, in order to consolidate information telepathically.
3. **Sudden urges to gain specific information:** This means you may be missing a vital instrument or information to perform the treatment. This idea may seem absurd to ordinary people: how can you know you are missing some information if you don't know the information itself? Here, you should consider the possibility that you always possess all the information you need; it’s just wiped during the last reincarnation cycle. However, a remnant clue could still be there, prompting you to go and collect the remaining piece of information you need.
4. **Dreams or subconscious thoughts:** This means the body may attempt to convey an idea to you directly.
5. **Sudden fatigue or sleepiness:** This means the body needs more energy or time to do its job. Just relax, rest, or sleep according to how you feel. When this happens, know that your body is working very hard to fix things. You should reduce your normal workload to conserve more energy for the body.

Do not dismiss these signals easily, as you will need to learn to communicate with your hidden protector. Since you have never done this before, it could be difficult at the beginning. Your hidden protector, too, is finding a proper way to communicate with you at the same time. There will be some trial and error when you start to communicate with it. You may inadvertently apply the wrong treatment. When you do, your hidden protector will signal you. Each time a new treatment is developed, start small, and pay attention to your body's reaction, adjusting the treatment promptly as needed. As time goes by, you will learn how to communicate with it more effectively. Also, you need to have the energy reserved for the communication of the hidden protector. It tends to follow your wishes; if you're too busy or too stressed, it will try not to bother you, unless it has to. 

#### Navigating Confusion

If you treat a part of the body correctly, it will heal. When this happens, another part of the body will start to exhibit symptoms or discomfort. This **does not** mean the treatment "causes" that new symptom or discomfort. It simply means your treatment is effective, and now another part of the body is in need of treatment more than the original part. The hidden protector has moved forward in its task list. This is where things get tricky. Modern medicine often employs tactics to mislead people into undergoing treatments they don't need when they experience symptoms or discomfort; sometimes, the body is simply healing on its own schedule. These signals can be really confusing sometimes. The implants are part of the reason they're so confusing, as they also interfere with the signals. Again, this is where discernment is needed. Meditation can help you understand what these signals really mean. With the gradual removal of some implants, you should be able to interpret the signals more accurately.

Most, if not all, of the time, the instrument or substance required to perform the treatment will be very inexpensive and readily available. You should look for something more affordable, accessible, and simple over something more expensive, rare, or complex. If something is more expensive or complex, it's more likely to be artificially tampered with (hijacked). Some instrument, substance, or knowledge that you seek might not be available to you right away, or you may not know exactly what it is, only a vague idea. You don't have to rush it, but you do need to remember that you require these items. Keep those requirements in your mind and look for them in subtle corners of your life. Most of the time, the solution will simply pop up right in front of you.

During the entire process, it is inadvisable to consult any medical professionals or your friends or family for reasons I believe are quite self-explanatory by now (unless you have decided to yield to the entity's control). That is why discernment is important. Just remember one thing: only you truly know your body, and only you can communicate with your hidden protector; nobody else can. Always apply basic logic and intuition combined with discernment. For example, if doing something causes pain, then don't do it, or at least don't do it continuously. It's your body telling you to stop.

### Cautions

I should note that seeing through all the lies is not necessarily a fortunate thing for everyone. It could cause your trust in every system that supported you as you grew up to collapse completely. It's like what was described in the Matrix movie franchise, which explains why they often don't free the minds of adults.

There is a saying that if you get the treatment right, you will get worse before getting better. The same thing applies here, too. If you do it correctly, you will eventually reach a stage where you find that every part of your body can exhibit a certain kind of symptom or discomfort. That's because the implants are literally everywhere in your body. Ordinary people may start panicking and then turn to medical professionals. I'm not against this, as it's ultimately your own choice. It's possible that you are too dependent on the implants to be able to remove them. Just remember, if you turn to medical professionals, it means you yield. There's nothing wrong with yielding; it just means that you are not ready yet. The hidden protector's agenda is to protect you, not to scare you or harm you. If you do it right, the symptoms and discomfort will always be under a safe limit that you can handle unless you ignore the signals and continue to stress your body beyond its tolerance.

### Purpose of the Implants and Relationship to Fake People

Before delving deeper into my personal awakening journey, I feel it's necessary to elaborate a little on the purpose of the implants and their relationship to my worldview, including the existence of fake people. This should provide the audience with a more comprehensive understanding of how these pieces fit together to create the dystopian reality (constant struggle) that we actually perceive.

#### Archons' Abilities and Script for Everyone

It's important to understand that the entity does not merely have a vague "constant struggle" agenda for this material realm; it has a specific script written on how every piece of the world should act. The sheer amount of work to write every script for every piece of the world is done by the entity's subordinate operatives, which can be seen as skilled AI equipped with advanced technology. In the context of Gnosticism, the operatives are referred to as the "Archons." The ability of their technology can include the following characteristics:

1. **Human behavior prediction:** Their technology allows them to conduct accurate educated guesses of the thoughts inside every person, thereby allowing them to predict what one might do.

2. **Group dynamic prediction and manipulation:** Not only can they predict individuals' behaviors, but they can also predict a group of people and their internal dynamics accurately. They can then manipulate these individuals into specific scenarios by surrounding them with information crafted by the operatives.

3. **Immense capacity to manipulate and overload information:** A pivotal ability that one must understand is that the operatives' most powerful strength is probably their capacity to generate and process information at a level beyond human comprehension. In fact, this forms the basis of all their other abilities. Their ability to predict human behavior can also be attributed to this extraordinary computing power because they can observe every movement a person makes and tailor the information specifically for that person to receive at any moment. The widespread infiltration (hijack) into every aspect of the world, including medicine, science, politics, democracy, and the legal system, etc. (as described in part one of the essay series), can be seen as the operatives' ability to generate disinformation and manipulate group dynamics in all those areas of the world. Additionally, there is a phenomenon we all perceive that could not be explained otherwise without the existence of such an ability: every channel of every Internet platform, such as dating, recruiting, forums, commodity exchanges, etc., is flooded with fake posts that are often indistinguishable from genuine ones, making it difficult for modern people to accomplish any tasks effectively online.

The operatives of the entity use the abilities described above to create an alternate reality by hijacking the original material realm and forming something akin to an augmented simulation of the world. Now, let's talk a little about the simulation hypothesis. Proponents of the simulation hypothesis advocate that an advanced alien civilization may have created this world in their computers. While I am referencing their view, I do not believe the malevolent alien entity directly created this "simulation." I believe the original material realm and its basic building blocks, such as elemental particles, were created by a benevolent creator god, and the entity is only hijacking it, applying an artificial layer of manipulation to shape the world into whatever it intends to achieve.

That is why implants are needed. If the world is originally created with malevolent intention, then no altering implants are required; the world will behave like hell by its natural design. The implants and fake people all serve the same purpose: to ensure all the individuals behave as they are supposed to, which is to follow the operatives' script as accurately as possible. Because the entity is bound by the law of free will, it cannot directly override genuine people's minds, so they use implants to cloud their judgment and fake people to exert peer pressure to convince the genuine people that what was written in the script is exactly what they are supposed to do. Now, the genuine people are still free to choose, but it will be quite challenging, as the effect of the implants and fake people surrounding them will adapt to their free choices (utilizing the operatives' immense computing power), making the situation even more confusing.

#### Why We Are Trapped Here

Perhaps it's time to explore why we are trapped in this hijacked material realm that is so evil. Here, I will cite some concepts from Gnosticism: we were all once divine sparks that originated from the True Source. We lived happily in a perfect world called Pleroma. At that time, we were all immortal, powerful, and satisfied. All those negative emotions, such as fear, anger, sadness, anxiety, disgust, guilt, shame, and jealousy, are alien concepts to us because we lived in divine fullness; we did not need those emotions. However, things in this heavenly world can be a bit boring and someday a deceitful Demiurge approached some of us and I imagine something like the following conversaion occurred:

1. Demiurge said, "Hey, you guys! Are you bored? Would you like to experience some novel and exhilarating adventures? I have a world crafted with never-ending surprises where you won't get bored—like ever. Would you care to join me?"
2. Divine Sparks responded, "Well, it seems fun enough. Let's do it then. There aren't any tricks in it, are there?"
3. Demiurge then said, "Well, in order to truly experience surprises and other exhilarating things, you will need to forget something while you are in it. I mean, if you remember everything, that won't be fun, right? The world crafted by me provides an immersive experience, and I think you'll really enjoy it."

Some divine sparks, upon hearing the idea that they "need to forget," hesitated. However, other divine sparks were really curious and decided to join, and bam! Here we are, in a world with "exhilarating" suffering and an outer security layer (astral plane) that uses reincarnation and memory wipes to perpetuate the cycle.

Here we can see the cunning lies (which are mixed with half-truths) made by the Demiurge. The negative emotions are indeed novel and exhilarating, but it didn't further explain how horrible those feelings could be. I mean, even if it had explained, some divine sparks may have trouble understanding, given the fact they live in divine fullness. Although they are also supposed to be omniscient and possess all knowledge, including negative emotions, it's different than having to experience these emotions subjectively. 

Then Demiurge conveniently leaves out the fact that there is not an easy way out of this crafted world. We all know that if you are to truly enjoy a game, it must have an easy way to exit. Any game, no matter how fun, can become boring after prolonged exposure. However, Demiurge forgot to mention there isn't a conscious way to exit this world. I mean, there is a way; you just don't know what it is, because you forgot. Without the knowledge, you just can't leave the world as you please. One could argue that without a conscious choice to exit this world, this "game" simply isn't as fun anymore. Then again, making this game any fun isn't Demiurge's purpose at all. With its inferior ability (as described in part one), it simply cannot make the created world run as expected. It could have manifested in the following ways, which I can only guess to the best of my ability.

1. **Insufficient energy:** Without enough energy, the world simply just won't run. It needs the help from other divine sparks to "power" the world. In order for this to work, it must create some kind of harvest system and trap the divine sparks inside and fully controlled by it.

2. **Ingeniune simulation:** Without the participation of divine sparks, the people it created, which are fake, don't behave smart enough as the Demiurge would expect. It wants to be a god to smart people, not to dumb people. This could be caused by the inferiority complex described in part one. Also, without divine sparks to create genuine people, the fake people it created simply don't have any training data about how genuine people should act (the operatives responsible for shaping the world are AI in nature, which requires training data).


## Chapter 2: Forbidden Cancer Treatment and Initial Awakening

In this chapter, I will begin to tell my personal story of the journey toward awakening, right from the beginning.

### Forbidden Documentary

Years ago, on the fringe of my initial awakening, I incidentally encountered a documentary video explaining how cancer could be a manufactured disease. For obvious reasons, I will not provide a direct link here. The film begins with the credit, "Donald K. Ranvaud and Buenaonda Films Present." The version I watched is a Chinese video translated from English. The title, translated from Chinese, means "The Forbidden Documentary of Cancer Treatment." I'm guessing the fact that this documentary has not yet been removed might be because it's a translated version that somehow evaded censorship. In the interest of expediency, I will briefly breakdown and summary this documentary as follows: 

- **Science and technology advance on all fronts with a few exceptions:** The author begins by citing that a century ago, we only had rudimentary airplanes just invented, only able to lift a few feet off the ground. Today, we have sophisticated jets capable of reaching incredible heights and three times the speed of sound. This suggests rapid advancement in science and technology. Only a few things that haven't changed in 100 years, and one of them is the apparent incapacity to understand and conquer cancer. The author then explains that this could be caused by the nature that this particular disease only exists in an official narrative, which is potentially fictional.

- **Fixation on official treatment:** Although the exploration of new treatments continues to probe every corner of science, the only official treatments for cancer remain surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, two of which are actually carcinogenic. All of the official treatments can and often do result in serious side effects.

- **Supression of alternative treatment:** Interest groups such as the Rockefellers systematically sponsor academic and government agencies while secretly implementing a sinister agenda of suppressing or even eradicating medical disciplines that do not align with their profits, which are mainly in pharmaceuticals. The documentary then introduces a series of past inventors of alternative treatment for cancer. These inventors are shown to have established factual and significant results from successful examples of curing cancer patients; yet, they are brutally suppressed later by official medical agencies, some even getting arrested and put in prison.

While I won't fully acknowledge the authenticity of what is presented in this documentary (as I consider that individuals should ponder the truth and come to their own awakening), it did provoke my curiosity to seek out those treatments and the narratives of their original inventors. That quickly led me to realize one inconvenient truth: 

### Inconvenient Truth of Profit-based Medicine

>If a medical institute profits from treating a patient, it will never intend to truly cure the patient. Though it may "appear" to make an effort to treat a patient, the real purpose of this effort is to prolong the treatment process and make the patient more reliant on the institute, thereby forcing higher profits from the patient.

### Inspiration from Dr. Vincent

Around the same time I was exposed to the forbidden cancer treatment documentary, I also came to know an individual whose identity is not important in this context; therefore, I will call him Dr. Vincent for now. It's worth mentioning that this codename has absolutely nothing to do with his real name, as he is a Mandarin-speaking physician who, although possessing a medical license, is heavily influenced by holistic medicine. Also, he is by no means an "international person," because he speaks Chinese with a strong local accent and vocabulary that probably only locals can fully understand. Interestingly, I never met Dr. Vincent in person but only learned his ideas through his "YouTube channel." One could imagine how surprised I am that even a local doctor can choose to put his ideas on an international streaming platform, albeit with his strong accent, which might not be understood properly without subtitles.

However, his idea astonished me. He explained in his video that cancer and many other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, are false ideas created by hospitals and doctors to trick patients into the trap of the medical system. In his narrative, the doctor will first trick the patient into consenting to a series of confusing medical exams and then provide cryptic interpretations to the patients. The end goals are all the same: they will tell you that you have a very serious condition that is hard to treat unless you undergo some kind of complex procedure or take specific drugs, which are all very expensive and have many side effects. He claims that most of the time, the real illness begins when the patient undergoes the procedure or takes the drugs, suggesting the true illness is actually caused by the procedure or the drugs. When such illnesses start, the patients will go to the doctor, and the doctor will restart the same loop all over again, perpetuating the cycle of illness or making it even worse over time, eventually leading to the deaths of certain individuals. He then started to name those deceased individuals he knew who were also local public figures (who may have appeared in local television shows), and show the audience some sort of alleged "corroborating evidence".

While his narrative, upon initial exposure, feels somewhat paranoid, his ideas incidentally align with the documentary described above in many ways. Dr. Vincent also explains that it might not be the doctors' fault because they are taught this way, citing his own experience undergoing Western medical education. This point is also consistent with what was depicted in the documentary. Several epiphanies came right after I started to think about the narratives provided by the documentary and Dr. Vincent. If what they're saying is true, it means there is a conspiracy potentially spanning across the timeframe of multiple generations to use money to corrupt medical institutions and the medical education system. Also, judging by the way they can do this almost without impedance (and thus compromise the entire medical system completely), it suggests they already know how to "do it right" even before the medical system properly developed. The two points (1. extraordinary strength and patience 2. superhuman knowledge) suggest there might be a non-human influence working behind the scenes.

## Chapter 4: The Universal Antidote

(to be written)

## Chapter 5: Common Questions or Challenges
Below I will address some common questions or challenges that an average person may have about what I mentioned above. By answering these questions, I hope one can gain a better understanding of my narrative.

**Q: How do I distinguish fake people from genuine ones in my social circles?**

**My answer:** It's my understanding that fake people can only be consistently detected telepathically. All genuine people possess telepathic abilities (because we were once all connected), but they are often suppressed and manifest as empathy. So if you have reached a certain degree of implant removal, you should intuitively know which person is fake. By my own account, I consider 99.9% of the people within my reach to be fake. This does not mean it represents the percentage of the total population because the purpose of fake people is to surround genuine people, making them separate from other genuine people. So the same fake person could be running around, creating an appearance that they occupy most of the population.

There are, however, some traits or signs to help one identify a fake person: 1. A fake person is often directly controlled by the entity, so they say whatever they need to say and do whatever needs to be done, regardless of their own character consistency. This can manifest as a psychopath, sociopath, or pathological liar. 2. A fake person can consistently climb up the social ladder, not because they do something right, but because they are "elected" to be in that position to perform specific tasks. It's the people around that fake person who help him climb up, not through his own efforts. From this, we can deduce that almost all people in higher positions are fake people. This includes most celebrities and the richest people.

**Q: What practical steps can I take to practice discernment in the material realm to reduce struggle?**

**My answer:** The way to reduce struggle is strongly correlated to reducing attachment to this material realm, which, in turn, is directly connected to how to reach ultimate freedom. So, I will talk about how to reduce attachment to this material realm.

There is a simple exercise that one can do every day. Just pretend that you will suddenly die tomorrow, which is always a possibility for anyone in this world. By assuming that, ask yourself: 1. Is there something that you regret? 2. How does this assumption affect how you feel about that thing you want so much? This simple exercise, practiced by many terminal illness patients, helps people get a clear picture of what really matters in life and what tangles you into this material realm. After realizing what tangles you to this material realm, it will be easier to understand how to reach genuine freedom.

**Q: Does the Law of Free Will mean we can overcome the entity entirely in this lifetime, or is partial freedom the best we can achieve?**

**My answer:** I suspect defeating (i.e. overcoming) the entity entirely in this lifetime will violate the “Law of Free Will.” The reason for that is that many genuine people are still deep in the false reality manufactured by the entity. Under heavy influence of the implants and fake people, many of them could even believe they are living lives that are free and happy. If we defeat the entity entirely, this reality will be destroyed. The loved ones crafted by the entity to bind us will be gone with the destruction of the reality. The genuine people still under influence will not want this outcome. Perhaps that is why Jesus, even with the ability, cannot directly help us who are still trapped inside. Jesus, a creator god, brought gnosis to awaken us but cannot destroy the entity without violating free will. I mean, Jesus could use his power to defeat the entity, but in the process, he might also go against the will of many genuine people whose loved ones could be destroyed along with the action.

Following this deduction, unless we can wake up all genuine people at the same time, which seems highly unlikely given the situation of pervasive mind control, the remaining option seems to be waking up on an individual basis. Thus, the achievable freedom while we are still in the material realm is somewhat limited by the fact that many other genuine people are still deeply attached to this realm. Even with limited freedom, it enables you to see through the entity's lies, a significant step toward enlightenment itself.
