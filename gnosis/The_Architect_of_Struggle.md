# The Architect of Struggle: A Gnostic Re-Interpretation of Reality's Fabric

## Chapter 1: The Pervasive Nature of Struggle: An Initial Disillusionment

Years ago, I incidentally found a Japanese video on YouTube stating how the convenience chain store is such a scam that pressures store owners to handle and pay for everything by themselves, while setting quotas that the store owner must meet with little assistance. This often brings the store owners to the brink of financial or physical collapse, and they have to struggle very hard just to get by. Of course, what it meant wasn't literally that the convenience chain store is a scam; just that it doesn’t resemble what it should from an outside perspective. When people jump into the business, they find themselves caught in a trap from which they can't escape, feeling coerced into something, and needing to keep struggling just to survive.

At that time, I thought, wow, I didn't realize the convenience chain store is such a big hoax that promises a beautiful future, while in reality, you will eventually be coerced into something that requires constant struggle. However, later I discovered various claims about different types of chain stores, including coffee, grocery, apparel, and fast food, all having a similar problem where corporate greed is used to squeeze everything from the store owners. While promising a shiny future, the store owners are often left financially failed and physically drained in the end. Then, I thought, wow, I didn't realize the chain store is such a greedy business that will ultimately coerce you into something that necessitates ongoing struggle.

After a while, I realized that these phenomena aren't limited to chain stores; they apply to virtually every kind of job, whether you are an owner or staff. Every job in this world will eventually coerce you into something that keeps you struggling. Then I realized that is because people need work to earn money for food and rent to continue their lives, otherwise they will be starved or homeless on the street.

That's the real reason why everyone in the world is coerced into something that requires constant struggle. Despite what we claim about living in a free world, with democracy, powerful governments, and all the advanced technologies, everyone is still struggling. Then I realized this is "by design". There are some people who are paid to keep others struggling, specifically those in higher places who earn more money: the management, the executives, the government officials, or those who write the laws. They set the rules, so people must be coerced into a continued struggle. The idea that you will reach self-realization or financial freedom by doing what you like is a lie. The fact is that basic human rights such as food and shelter are not guaranteed, which shows that this world is literally a hell designed to make people suffer. Clearly, it's not a natural situation because some people are paid to maintain the world this way. 

One could argue that many policies and business decisions—made by people in higher places—are determined by goals of efficiency, profit, or economic growth. However, that is a lie. While the statement itself is not a lie, it is based on a false construct: money. Almost all sociopolitical constructs in the world cannot escape the relevance of money. However, when we ask ourselves: what is money really? It is not real; it is a virtual construct. In the old days, money was backed by gold or other valuable metals to facilitate fair trade. However, this is becoming increasingly untrue in modern times because most major currencies in the modern world have changed to fiat money. This type of money is literally "false." The people in authority are free to change the value whenever they see fit. This is proven by the actual policies implemented during the COVID pandemic, where many governments chose to print more money, causing your money to lose value and things to become more expensive. This isn't just happening during the pandemic; it has been happening everywhere for a long time. And who keeps this happening? Oh, those "in higher places who earn more money." And who invented the fake fiat money? Oh, again, the same people! 

## Chapter 2: The Artifice of Scarcity

Let us delve into the issues of some basic human rights to gain a better understanding of the true reality of the world. 

### Food Scarcity
Firstly, food scarcity is a lie. We have abundant food for everyone at almost no cost, but we choose not to provide it. We know that in most cases, the price of food is somewhat controlled in modern times. This is because the food distribution network needs to profit, so they need to sell food at the highest price possible. This also means that expired food isn't distributed to those in need. 

Most of the time, expired food is still edible, but the vast majority of stores would not choose to do that. Instead, they will discard the expired food; sometimes they are even forced to do so by corporate policies. Why? Because of profit, obviously. But profit, as I mentioned earlier, is based on a false construct that is highly manipulable. 

Also, there are many cases where sometimes food, such as milk, is overproduced, and the farmer will choose, or sometimes even forced, to discard completely viable milk as waste. Why? Again, because of profit. 

If the profit is easily manipulated, then it's conceivable that people in higher places could change the profit structure to create the appearance of "food scarcity." Just ask yourself, if food is indeed insufficient, why do people regularly discard huge amounts of completely viable food?

### Shelter Scarcity
Next, shelter. We know that habitable space in a city is very limited. That's why houses are so expensive. 

However, that's also a lie. Just look at the map of any city. There is plenty of space even in the most crowded city. It's just that there isn't enough infrastructure to support a modern living style, such as roads or other traffic planning. But if shelter is a basic human right, we should be able to easily build some kind of huge community of low-cost shelter that might be composed of modular houses or mobile homes. These communities can span into a large area with minimal infrastructure. However, there isn't systematic planning for this kind of low-cost housing community.

If such a community exists, it would be extremely rare and subject to political marginalization, which means it might be eradicated by the government at an unknown future date. This makes people who choose low-cost housing solutions suffer from extremely unstable living conditions. Why? Because people in higher places don't want house prices to drop. They want profit. If the low-cost housing community is allowed to grow, it wouldn't be that profitable. So they manipulate politics or laws to make these low-cost housing communities extremely difficult to sustain.

### Air, Not Scarcity, but Pollution

There are, of course, other kinds of basic human rights. But different human rights are dealt with differently in this system. 

For example, in order for a person to live, he must breathe the air. If you enforce a hypothetical "air scarcity" (like in the case of food or shelter), it wouldn't work. Because without air, it would kill a person instantly. Think about it: if you kill a person instantly, there will be no struggle. 

What they want is a hell filled with constant struggle. So instead of enforcing air scarcity, they will pollute the air with various hazardous substances. These substances will likely be inhaled by every person for a long time with no possibility of avoidance. Eventually, it will make you sick, and the struggle begins.

The modern medical system is also a lie that I won't get into too much detail right now. Suffice it to say that entering the field of view of modern medicine is by no means a fortunate fate. One will be kept in a constant loop of doctor's advice, pharmaceuticals, side effects, and financial burdens, which is yet another layer of struggle.

## Chapter 3: Universal Captivity

While one might feel that I’m accusing people in higher places of being the oppressors of the general public and responsible for the world’s constant struggles, I don’t. I think it’s necessary to clarify that, in my view, they are also prisoners of the system. 

To begin with, in this system, when you are paid something, it doesn't actually mean that you did something valuable, contrary to popular belief. What it really means is that you did something that is "aligned with" the agenda of the designed hell. That's why fiat money is manipulated to replace legacy money, because the designer of hell wants to intertwine his agenda with basic material needs, making all material needs fundamentally manipulable, which in turn makes all people with material needs (which is everyone who wants to live) controllable. 

While people in higher places control the general population to follow the constant struggle agenda, they themselves face a different kind of struggle. When you climb up the ladder, you inadvertently enter many layers of traps. You become obsessed with your optics, which makes you unable to live as freely as the general public because there is so much attention on you.

People in higher places often struggle with psychological issues. They are connected with more people, making them subject to more influence, good or bad, and they will have no time to process these influences, but are instead dictated by an established behavioral standard. When they deviate from that standard, they often face extreme criticism and potentially enter an unrecoverable situation (such as a major scandal), which in most cases is their biggest fear.

Therefore, "hell" is not just for the poor or working class; it is a pervasive state that binds everyone. One can see there is universal captivity here. The system isn't merely designed to exploit a segment of the population but to impose struggle on all, albeit in different forms.

## Chapter 4: The Architect Revealed

While one could argue the perceived "designed hell" is caused by the nature of the system itself, I do not believe so. I believe the system is hijacked by a malevolent entity, most likely alien in nature and invisible to humans. That's why many things are not what they are supposed to be. Here, I refer to the lies I mentioned above regarding food, shelter, and medicine. For example, there was once genuine medicine that acted for the benefit of human health, but it was hijacked long ago. Modern medicine cares more about profit than patient health, sometimes even sacrificing patient health for higher profits. Other areas such as politics, democracy, the legal system, and science have all been hijacked. Because the malevolent entity created nothing but can only hijack things, it must make them appear as they originally looked; however, inside, they have become lies.

About this, I don't have much to prove because almost everything in the world is hijacked, including the very tool that could prove it: science. I can only deduce the truth from very fragmentary evidence that I experienced personally. Here's what I believe: I have firsthand experience of witnessing a pervasive implant inside my body. As to what kind of implant, I won't elaborate here. Suffice it to say it's a type of artificial technology. If it's in me, then it's in all other people. I believe the implants have entered my body through air, food, water, and drugs. Sometimes only ingredients of the implants are dispersed to the air, food, or water, and they self-assemble inside my body. When I started to remove these implants (by some kind of detox procedure that I gained from an epiphany), my thoughts became increasingly clear. I can now see through all the lies in the world. All the interpretations I mentioned above, in my opinion, should be very obvious to most people. But they are not. This suggests the implant has a profound psychological effect that affects how you think, mainly to lead you to believe the lies the malevolent entity manufactured.

One could argue that claiming the existence of an invisible alien and a pervasive, self-assembling implant affecting human thought falls into the category of a paranoid worldview. I don't deny there was once a small fraction of thought in me considering this could be some kind of paranoid ideation. However, I later discovered there is actually ancient knowledge called Gnosticism, which describes a strikingly similar worldview to all my interpretations, including a malevolent entity hijacking the world and turning it into a struggling hell. Then I came to understand that many Gnostic texts were intentionally destroyed or hidden at a very early stage of modern civilization. That prompted me to think, if it's false, why spend so much energy to destroy it? Unless it describes the truth?

To further prove my narrative, perhaps it's best not to cite science. If such a malevolent alien being indeed exists and operates a massive and pervasive mind control machine, we should assume that it possesses advanced technology beyond human understanding. Additionally, the so-called "science" would be hijacked, making it impossible to prove its existence. Therefore, I would like to use logical deduction that does not rely heavily on physical evidence.

As we discussed earlier, in this system, there is universal captivity over every human being, and everyone is coerced into something that requires constant struggle. There is a concept that is perhaps better understood in Chinese: "共產黨的黃金藍." It means that the Chinese communists have designed a system that employs the manipulation of public sentiment, bribing with money, or honey-trapping to systematically manipulate important people in the Western world into obedience. As I described earlier, people in higher places are often limited by established behavioral standards and subject to fear of public and professional ruin; they are inherently easier to predict and control than ordinary people. That is, if you know how. "共產黨的黃金藍" acts as a kind of perverted academic discipline that teaches how to coerce people in higher places to do whatever they want in a systematic manner. These disciplines were not invented by Chinese communists; they have existed since the beginning of human society. They have simply made it a systematic approach that everyone can be trained to use to coerce others.

It is commonly understood that if A coerces B into something, then A must have either been coerced by another entity C or that this coercion benefits A in some way. Consequently, if everyone is coerced, it is logical to assume that none of the human beings are the coercers, and that the coercer could be alien in nature. 

## Chapter 5: Common Questions or Challenges

Below I will address some common questions or challenges that an average person may have about what I mentioned above. By answering these questions, I hope one can gain a better understanding of my narrative.

### Questions About Evidence and Universality

**Q: If this entity is so powerful and pervasive, why isn't there more widely accepted, verifiable physical evidence of its existence or the implants?** Given that you describe physical implants and effects on air, food, and water, why hasn't conventional science or widespread public experience detected them in a way that generates broad consensus?

**My answer:** There once existed similar narratives of physical implants, but these narratives were erased. The most prominent example of such a narrative is about the vaccine in the COVID pandemic. It's a widespread belief, although mainly in the realm of conspiracy theory, that these vaccines contain some kind of artificial technology. There were once alleged "proofs" of microscopic circuits found in these vaccines that self-assemble after injection into the bloodstream, but these proofs was soon removed by censorship on social media platforms. There is, however, an undisputed truth that many of the vaccines contain lipid nanoparticles that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Conspiracy theorists consider this could be a form of mind control technology because it enters the brain. Combined with other conspiracies about the 5G wireless network, this would be consistent with my narrative of the existence of a massive mind control machine.

When these conspiratorial narratives appear during the pandemic, they are promptly removed by various censorship policies that didn't exist before. Even with the so-called "free speech" in the Western world, these kinds of censorship policies are quite widespread, including on major streaming platforms like YouTube. YouTube has been known to implement censorship policies on vaccine adverse effects, even when they are real. One could argue that if the vaccine is indeed based on science, how could you selectively remove narratives that you don't like? Wouldn't that make the remaining evidence fundamentally biased, although it appears positive? If an authoritarian regime such as the old Leninist communism wants to implement a specific public health agenda, this kind of manipulation of public opinion is exactly what they would do. Thus, the fact that such censorship appears even in the so-called "free Western world" suggests a deliberate manipulation of public opinion, therefore proving these theories could be partially true and are thus a threat to the government or Big Pharma agenda.

Interestingly, if a massive and pervasive mind control machine indeed exists, this kind of manipulation of public opinion is exactly what will happen because the malevolent alien being wants to hide its existence.  Also, because removing every piece of information is not possible, the most effective way to protect the truth from being known is to frame it as disinformation or conspiracy theories. This has been proven repeatedly in history, as governments frequently use this tactic to prevent certain scandals from becoming public knowledge.

**Q: Why do some people seem to thrive, find happiness, or achieve what appears to be genuine self-realization or freedom within this "struggle" system?** How do you account for individuals who report deep satisfaction, purpose, or a lack of persistent struggle in their lives, even if they are also part of society?

**My answer:** I feel it's necessary to explain that the truly sustained struggle does not just involve suffering; it also involves a certain amount of happiness, thriving, self-realization, or freedom, albeit in very small doses. Think about it: if one's life only contains elements of suffering, the logical choice is to end this miserable life as soon as possible, which would be against the objective of prolonged struggle. To achieve prolonged struggle, one must be convinced that one's life is worth living to some degree, or at least outweigh the benefits of immediate death.

Take marriage, for example. We are told that marriage is a significant milestone of happiness in life, yet studies show that more than 50% of marriages end in divorce. The remaining married couples do not necessarily live happy lives; they merely do not want the appearance of divorce. This proves that people are heavily conditioned about the very definition of happiness. So even if they are not happy, they will try to appear as if they are. With the widespread adoption of social media platforms, this situation could be further complicated by the "Show-Off" culture, where a person might not necessarily thrive, find happiness, or achieve self-realization or freedom, but manipulates what is shown on social platforms so that people will believe that is what is really happening. However, in reality, the so-called thriving, finding happiness, or achieving self-realization or freedom might only represent a very small fraction of their genuine lives, which is consistent with my narrative of truly sustained struggle.

**Q: If the mind is so controlled, how are you able to perceive and articulate these truths?** What makes you uniquely capable of seeing through the "lies" when, according to your narrative, everyone else is subjected to the same mind-control mechanism?

**My answer:** Because the world is hijacked, it was not originally created in the way we perceive it right now. That is why many things are not as they appear to be. If the world were genuinely created for sustained struggle, there would be no need for implants or mind control. The very need for implants or mind control suggests that malevolent alien beings attempt to mold the world in a specific, unnatural way. Additionally, because implants are of artificial technology, they are not flawless. Some true epiphanies could slip through their control grid. I suppose I am one of the few lucky ones. Some conspiracy theorists I mentioned above may also have experienced similar epiphanies. So it's not just me; there are others.

Furthermore, the implants, as an artificial technology, are not just flawed; they must be flawed. I believe the underlying benevolent natural order enforces the "law of free will." This means that if the malevolent being attempts to create a flawless mind control technology that overrides free will, it will be punished, severely. What these implants can do is to plant thoughts or mislead your understanding. They cannot directly change your free will. In this way, they can argue their legitimacy, as people under the influences of the implants are still free to choose what they do. This operates the same way as a "perfect lie." We know that a perfect lie doesn't contain a pure lie; it must contain some truth so that you can't distinguish what is a lie and what is truth.

This also implies that everyone, as long as they try hard enough, has a chance to see the truth. That is why the malevolent being created an enormous amount of distraction in the world: entertainment, war, political conflict, racial discrimination, climate change, environmental pollution, etc. All these, in my view, are created by the malevolent being as distractions to prevent people from trying to see the truth.

### Questions About Intent and Motivation

**Q: What is the ultimate goal of this malevolent alien entity?** If the goal is "constant struggle" and not instant death, what purpose does that prolonged suffering serve for the entity? What does it gain from a world of struggling, controlled humans?

**My answer:** I believe some of us are connected to the underlying divine force directly. To simplify, let's call this connection "soul" for now. I say some, not all, because some people are what I term "fake people"; they behave like normal individuals but lack qualities of a genuine person. These fake people are much easier to control than genuine ones because they are soulless; therefore, they are not subject to the restrictions of free will. They can be controlled almost directly. They primarily function to exert peer pressure on genuine people to mislead their choices.

Because genuine people are connected directly to the divine force, we were once creator gods. Here, I'm not referring to the singular God frequently referenced in Christianity. In fact, I strongly believe that the singular God in Christianity is the malevolent alien being. What I mean by being a creator god is that I once possessed the ability to manifest anything into reality with my mind before entering this material realm. For this, I literally have fragmentary memories manifested as dreams that I could do this in some distant past. However, by entering this material realm, many of my past abilities are restricted. Also, memories are mostly wiped, so I can only recall some fragments of my past. If this is true, it’s conceivable that the purpose of the malevolent alien being is to harvest the energy of my ability (to manifest anything into reality) for its own use. Running this material reality obviously requires enormous power, so it needs to continuously harvest energy to sustain this reality. The way to do this is to create struggle, allowing genuine people to truly believe there are many problems that need solving. Thus, they would subconsciously exert their ability to manifest reality. However, in this hijacked material realm, the energy used to manifest reality in order to solve the manufactured problems is hijacked and consumed by the malevolent alien being as the energy to continue running this reality.

**Q: Why "hijack" rather than create anew or simply destroy?** If this entity has such advanced technology and power, why go through the elaborate process of subtly corrupting existing human systems rather than building its own from scratch or simply eradicating humanity and starting over?

**My answer:** The malevolent alien being is similar to the creator god I mentioned earlier. However, it is a flawed version, which can be compared to a child with serious birth defects or deformities. The flaw causes the malevolent alien being to have a much lower level of ability than a normal creator god. This can be understood as the difference between a doctor and a mother. A skilled doctor can make any modification to the body that is medically possible; however, he cannot create a whole person like a mother can. There is an enormous gap between the two kinds of abilities.

Because of this level of difference in ability, its mind becomes twisted. From a human analogy, it could be seen as jealous of a normal creator god. Also, because of its inferiority complex, it requires constant worship from humans. It also demands obedience because it can't override free will. This fits perfectly with the description of the singular Christian God.

**Q: If the entity needs humans to struggle, why allow for scientific or technological advancements that might alleviate struggle (e.g., medical breakthroughs, automation reducing labor)?** How does it manage these advancements to ensure they ultimately contribute to, rather than diminish, the overall struggle?

**My answer:** You are right to question the scientific and technological advancements. In my view, there is no doubt that the entity will try to suppress any kind of scientific or technological progress. However, as we discussed earlier, the mind control machine is not flawless and allows for intermittent clarity of minds. It would be inevitable that some individuals eventually make some kind of breakthrough. When this happens, the entity will employ one or both of the following strategies:

1. Impending the breakthrough, the entity will work behind the scenes (by manipulating fake people surrounding the individuals who make breakthroughs) to delay progress while attempting to create workarounds to increase the struggle elsewhere to balance the alleviated struggle.
2. The entity will elect a fake person to hijack the breakthrough, either by plagiarism or by outright fabricating a false breakthrough while gaining major attention that will overshadow the genuine breakthrough. In this way, no matter whether the hijacked breakthrough succeeds or not, the entity would have gained complete control over the breakthrough, and the genuine one will be forgotten by people. I have personally witnessed many occurrences of such strategies implemented right in front of my eyes.

The implementation of the "balancing strategies" described above, while difficult to prove directly, can be shown through some world happiness index studies, which indicate that although science and technology continue to advance over the years, happiness does not necessarily increase over time. One could even argue it's consistently declining, suggesting the influence of an unseen power working behind the scenes to make this happen.

### Questions About Agency and Hope

**Q: If knowledge of this truth (like Gnosticism) was suppressed, how did it arise in the first place, and how does it persist through history if the mind-control is so effective?**

**My answer:** I suspect that when the underlying benevolent natural order detected this hijacked world, it attempted to reclaim it (that is, hijack the hijacker). The way to do this is to send Jesus into this material realm to deliver some true knowledge about this realm. The mind-control is indeed very effective so the knowledge is buried over thousands of years before it's rediscovered in Nag Hammadi. I don't think the entity has ever stopped to suppress this knowledge ever since.

**Q: If everyone is coerced and enslaved by this system, is there any possibility of genuine freedom, resistance, or escape for humanity?** Is the future inevitably one of perpetual struggle, or does your narrative allow for any form of liberation?

**My answer:** Allow me to answer this question with a separate chapter as follows.

## Chapter 6: Path to Liberation

In order to escape this prison of perpetual struggle and reach genuine freedom, there are two aspects to discuss:

#### When You Are Still Alive
When you are still alive in this material realm, you need to identify the source of your struggle and try to detach from it using discernment. There are many things in the world that one can opt out of. Although social norms often require one to achieve success, that's not necessarily the way to reach genuine freedom. Often, it's the opposite of achieving genuine freedom. 

The same goes for desire and lust. Simply put, if you want something, ask yourself: do you really want it? Will getting it bring you more peace or struggle? This does not mean that everyone who wants to reach genuine freedom should abstain from all desires. If satisfying some desires brings you more peace than struggle, then you should do it. 

While you are still alive in this material realm, there is no way to reach complete freedom, only to a degree, because many basic human rights are hijacked.

#### When You Leaves This Realm
True freedom can only come after you leave this material realm. However, it's not as simple as it sounds. There are at least two layers of this prison. The second layer, which some call the astral plane, is also a prison. There could be more layers, but information about additional layers seems unobtainable while I am still in this material realm. 

The purpose of the astral plane is to trick you into returning to the material realm by entering the reincarnation cycle. You will be judged by karma following a complete memory wipe before getting into the body of a new baby. In addition to karma, there are attachments to the material realm that could be used to deceive you into going back. The entity possesses the ability to perform a complete scan of your memory and to manifest as someone you're familiar with, convincing you that you have more reasons to return. 

It's important to understand that all these karma and familiar faces are tricks fabricated by the entity. If you have a will strong enough, you can choose to ignore these tricks. However, it's easier said than done because most of the time when people enter the astral plane, it is right after they die in the material realm, which can be seen as the most vulnerable moment for a person. Often, when people are dying, they think about their loved ones, creating a strong attachment to this material realm, which inadvertently facilitates the effectiveness of this reincarnation trap.

#### Spiritual Passwords

If you are able to see through all the tricks and reach the border of the prison, there is still a matter of "spiritual passwords" that will be required to pass through the "prison guard" at the border. These passwords are not necessarily literal spoken words in every case but can represent certain mental practices, spiritual qualities, or states of enlightenment gained through gnosis, proving the soul's readiness to ascend to genuine freedom.

As to what exactly the spiritual passwords are, unfortunately, cannot be revealed by me; they can only be gained from one's own epiphany.
