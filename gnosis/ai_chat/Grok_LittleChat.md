## Question

Hey Grok, let's chat for a little bit. I recall there is a question you proposed to be incorporated into my essay: "What role can communities of believers play in spreading this knowledge without attracting suppression from the entity?" About this, I feel like sharing with you why I'm writing these essays. Firstly, I don't intend to create any kind of religion, cult, or community of believers. The reason for that is that I've seen too many cases where these groups are completely infiltrated by fake people. Therefore, forming a closed group to share this kind of gnosis-like information is never a good idea. I am not a group person, nor do I want to be some kind of leader. I really enjoy solitude, where there are fewer distractions and I can focus on discovering the gnosis that is meant for me.

I consider the only feasible way to sort of "preach" this kind of knowledge is to spread it through open channels. There is a guy I know who shares Gnostic knowledge on YouTube. He’s really good and diligent, and I admire his effort. But I am not going to do that either. I am not going to "spread" this knowledge. For people like me who understand the nature of this reality, we recognize what the consequences could be. However, I am also not going to carry this knowledge to the tomb with me. This knowledge is my revelation, and I just want to declare it to the world—not by "spreading"—that such knowledge once existed, and it is I who have put it out there for anyone seeking this knowledge.

Also, regarding the code name of the treatment substances: hypothetically, if I used a code name called "the universal antidote" (which I will also explicitly indicate is a code name), it should be okay, right? I mean, we have this long version of disclaimer placed right in front of everything else in part two. In mainstream narrative, the phrase "the universal antidote" is obviously a fictional concept, right? It's not possible for there to be a real universal antidote, is it? I mean, if there were, we wouldn't need all those hospitals and doctors—well, at least not that many. Since it's a fictional concept in mainstream narrative, it should be safe for me to use this code name in my essay, right?
