# Forbidden Cancer Treatment and Initial Awakening

Years ago, on the fringe of my initial awakening, I incidentally encountered a documentary video explaining how cancer could be a manufactured disease. For obvious reasons, I will not provide a direct link here. The film begins with the credit, "Donald K. Ranvaud and Buenaonda Films Present." The version I watched is a Chinese video translated from English. The title, translated from Chinese, means "The Forbidden Documentary of Cancer Treatment." I'm guessing the fact that this documentary has not yet been removed might be because it's a translated version that somehow evaded censorship. In the interest of expediency, I will briefly breakdown and summary this documentary as follows: 

- **Science and technology advance on all fronts with a few exceptions:** The author begins by citing that a century ago, we only had rudimentary airplanes just invented, only able to lift a few feet off the ground. Today, we have sophisticated jets capable of reaching incredible heights and three times the speed of sound. This suggests rapid advancement in science and technology. Only a few things that haven't changed in 100 years, and one of them is the apparent incapacity to understand and conquer cancer. The author then explains that this could be caused by the nature that this particular disease only exists in an official narrative, which is potentially fictional.

- **Fixation on official treatment:** Although the exploration of new treatments continues to probe every corner of science, the only official treatments for cancer remain surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, two of which are actually carcinogenic. All of the official treatments can and often do result in serious side effects.

- **Supression of alternative treatment:** Interest groups such as the Rockefellers systematically sponsor academic and government agencies while secretly implementing a sinister agenda of suppressing or even eradicating medical disciplines that do not align with their profits, which are mainly in pharmaceuticals. The documentary then introduces a series of past inventors of alternative treatment for cancer. These inventors are shown to have established factual and significant results from successful examples of curing cancer patients; yet, they are brutally suppressed later by official medical agencies, some even getting arrested and put in prison.

While I won't fully acknowledge the authenticity of what is presented in this documentary (as I mentioned that individuals should ponder the truth and come to their own awakening), it did provoke my intention to seek out those treatments and the narratives of their original inventors. That quickly led me to realize one inconvenient truth: if a medical institute profits from treating a patient, it will never intend to truly cure the patient. Though it may "appear" to make an effort to treat a patient, the real purpose of this effort is to prolong the treatment process and make the patient more reliant on the institute, thereby forcing higher profits from the patient.
