# Development of "The Architect of Struggle" Series

This document describes the intention, conception, and development of "The Architect of Struggle" essay series.

## Overview

"The Architect of Struggle" essay series represents my evolving understanding of the true reality of this world (which has been deliberately kept hidden) since my initial awakening.

I have possessed this knowledge for many years but was unable to create a comprehensive description that a third party can understand due to its complicated, controversial, and provocative nature. That is, until the recent development of stronger AI (starting from ChatGPT). With help from the AI, I was able to compose a complete narrative through a series of interactive conversations with the AI, simulating a genuine discussion that allowed me to see the correct way to describe my narrative.

This does not mean the narrative is written by AI. Most of the text is still composed by me (which is a human :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, or should I say a "genuine person" according to my own narrative) and represents my true understanding of this material realm. I'm simply using AI to make it more comprehensive.

I should note that, even though many places in my narratives cite Gnostic concepts, I have only been exposed to Gnosticism in detail recently. It came as a surprise that many of my understandings coincide with what is written in these ancient texts. To understand my narrative, one does not need previous knowledge of Gnosticism, as I only reference its concepts occasionally and it does not affect the content of my narrative in any way. Also, I haven't studied Gnosticism enough to become some sort of scholar. There may be discrepancies between my narrative and Gnosticism. I'm only writing what I know to be true.

To make the content on this portal (Gnosis Center) more complete, I will provide links to all pertinent AI conversations that lead to the composition of my entire narrative in another section of this document for record-keeping purposes.

## Intention of Writing "The Architect of Struggle" Series

It's important for one to understand that **I don’t intend to create any kind of religion, cult, or community of believers.** The reason for that is that I’ve seen too many cases where these groups are completely infiltrated by fake people (explained in the essay series). Therefore, forming a closed group to share this kind of gnosis-like information is never a good idea.

I am not a group person, nor do I want to be some kind of leader. I really enjoy solitude, where there are fewer distractions and I can focus on discovering the gnosis that is meant for me.

I consider the only feasible way to sort of “preach” this kind of knowledge is to spread it through open channels. There is a guy I know who shares Gnostic knowledge on YouTube. He’s really good and diligent, and I admire his effort. But I am not going to do that either. 

I am not going to “spread” this knowledge. For people like me who understand the nature of this reality, we recognize what the consequences could be. However, I am also not going to carry this knowledge to the tomb with me.

This knowledge is my revelation, and I just want to declare it to the world—not by “spreading”—that such knowledge once existed, and it is I who have put it out there for anyone seeking this knowledge.
