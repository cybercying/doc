**Q: What practical steps can I take to practice discernment in the material realm to reduce struggle?**

**My answer:** The way to reduce struggle is strongly correlated to reducing attachment to this material realm, which, in turn, is directly connected to how to reach ultimate freedom. So, I will talk about how to reduce attachment to this material realm.

There is a simple exercise that one can do every day. Just pretend that you will suddenly die tomorrow, which is always a possibility for anyone in this world. By assuming that, ask yourself: 1. Is there something that you regret? 2. How does this assumption affect how you feel about that thing you want so much? This simple exercise, practiced by many terminal illness patients, helps people get a clear picture of what really matters in life and what tangles you into this material realm. After realizing what tangles you to this material realm, it will be easier to understand how to reach genuine freedom.

**Q: Does the Law of Free Will mean we can overcome the entity entirely in this lifetime, or is partial freedom the best we can achieve?**

**My answer:** I suspect defeating (i.e. overcoming) the entity entirely in this lifetime will violate the “Law of Free Will.” The reason for that is that many genuine people are still deep in the false reality manufactured by the entity. Under heavy influence of the implants and fake people, many of them could even believe they are living lives that are free and happy. If we defeat the entity entirely, this reality will be destroyed. The loved ones crafted by the entity to bind us will be gone with the destruction of the reality. The genuine people still under influence will not want this outcome. Perhaps that is why Jesus, even with the ability, cannot directly help us who are still trapped inside. Jesus, a creator god, brought gnosis to awaken us but cannot destroy the entity without violating free will. I mean, Jesus could use his power to defeat the entity, but in the process, he might also go against the will of many genuine people whose loved ones could be destroyed along with the action.

Following this deduction, unless we can wake up all genuine people at the same time, which seems highly unlikely given the situation of pervasive mind control, the remaining option seems to be waking up on an individual basis. Thus, the achievable freedom while we are still in the material realm is somewhat limited by the fact that many other genuine people are still deeply attached to this realm. Even with limited freedom, it enables you to see through the entity's lies, a significant step toward enlightenment itself.
