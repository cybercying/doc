**Q: Does the Law of Free Will mean we can overcome the entity entirely in this lifetime, or is partial freedom the best we can achieve?**

**My answer:** I suspect defeating (i.e. overcoming) the entity entirely in this lifetime will violate the “Law of Free Will.” The reason for that is that many genuine people are still deep in the false reality manufactured by the entity. Under heavy influence of the implants and fake people, many of them could even believe they are living lives that are free and happy. If we defeat the entity entirely, this reality will be destroyed. The loved ones crafted by the entity to bind us will be gone with the destruction of the reality. The genuine people still under influence will not want this outcome. Perhaps that is why Jesus, even with the ability, cannot directly help us who are still trapped inside. Jesus, a creator god, brought gnosis to awaken us but cannot destroy the entity without violating free will. I mean, Jesus could use his power to defeat the entity, but in the process, he might also go against the will of many genuine people whose loved ones could be destroyed along with the action.

Following this deduction, unless we can wake up all genuine people at the same time, which seems highly unlikely given the situation of pervasive mind control, the remaining option seems to be waking up on an individual basis. Thus, the achievable freedom while we are still in the material realm is somewhat limited by the fact that many other genuine people are still deeply attached to this realm. Even with limited freedom, it enables you to see through the entity's lies, a significant step toward enlightenment itself.
